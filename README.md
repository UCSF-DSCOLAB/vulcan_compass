# vulcan_compass
This repo encompasses a Snakemake workflow and additional vulcan configuration files that allow running the [Compass pipeline](https://github.com/wagnerlab-berkeley/Compass) on single-cell datasets of the UCSF Data Library.

The workflow is still under development, so can be expected to change a bit over time.
See [this file](resources/vignette.md) for the most up-to-date instructions and documentation of workflow capabilities.
