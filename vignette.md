# Workflow for: Targeted Compass Anaylsis of Pseudobulked Single-cell Datasets

This workflow starts with asking a few key parameterizations:
- dataset selection
- how to pseudobulk
- normalization method
- which species

It then performs pseudobulking and runs Compass towards processes in the categories:
- Central Carbon Metabolism
- Amino Acid Metabolism
- Lipid Metabolism

**Note that running the compass calculation takes a long time, often over a day!**

Lastly, you will be able to define 2 grouping of pseudobulks to compare and an interprettable plot will be generated.

Raw compass outputs as well as statistical outputs can then be downloaded for local followup if desired.
